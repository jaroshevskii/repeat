RepeatCLI is a simple command-line tool for text repeating, based on the [Repeat Example](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser/blob/doc-generation/Examples/repeat/Repeat.swift) from [Swift Argument Parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) library.

```zsh
% repeat-cli 'This text will be repeated three times with a counter ðŸ¦„' \
  --count 3 \
  --include-counter
1: This text will be repeated three times with a counter ðŸ¦„
2: This text will be repeated three times with a counter ðŸ¦„
3: This text will be repeated three times with a counter ðŸ¦„
